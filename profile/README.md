## 📄 Executive Summary/Abstract:
It has gone viral on social media that many children have become regular dialysis patients in hospitals. This is no coincidence. Based on data from the Indonesian Pediatric Association (IDAI), there has been a 70% increase in diabetes and kidney failure cases in children from 2010 to 2023. One of the main causes is the consumption of foods and drinks with high sugar content. Unfortunately, public awareness to read and understand nutritional value information labels on packaged products is still low, so the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension continues to increase.
NutriGo is here as a solution to help people easily access nutritional value information, especially the content of sugar, salt and fat (GGL), in order to support a healthy lifestyle and reduce the number of diseases caused by unhealthy eating patterns.
Our app has two types of inputs. First is the barcode of the packaged product and second is the image of packaged product. The image input is fed into our machine learning models to output a data for users.
